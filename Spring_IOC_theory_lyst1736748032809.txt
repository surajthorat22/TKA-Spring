Introduction with Spring Core :

what is spring : 
- it is lightweight, open source, lossely couple and integrated framework for developing enterprice application in java
- it was developed by Rod Johson in the year 2003.
- by using spring we can developed standalone and enterprice applications.
- the spring framework is one of the most popular java framework and it is used by many larged companies.
- the spring framework includes several modules such as IOC,AOP,DAO,context, ORM, web MVC etc.
- Spring can be easily integrated with others popular frameworks such as hibernate(ORM) and JPA
- it can be helps to improve the quality maintanibility, and scalibility of applications
- in a spring no need to write more code there are some annotations provide by the spring. 

- Spring Framework:
		- 2003 -- Rod Johnson -- sourceforge.net -- Open Source project.
		- Spring 1.x
		- Spring 2.x
		- * Spring 3.x -- Annotation based config.
		- * Spring 4.x => 4.x.x
		- Spring 5.x
		- Spring 6.x
		
- Spring Features/ Advantages 
		- Modular -- different jars for different functionalities.
		- Flexible -- Most of frameworks follow "All or nothing" policy -- Spring is exception
		- Test Driven Development -- Unit testing is well integrated in Spring + Supprt for other testing.
		- Maintainable/Extendable -- Start with interfaces & can change impl over the time.
		- Exceptions -- Spring convert/wraps all checked exception into unchecked one.
		- Dependency Injection


IOC (Inversion of control) : spring container / IOC container / Beans Container

- IoC container: (Inversion of control)
		-It is used to create object of class,maintain life cycle of object, manage its state,  by spring. So it is called Loosely coupling, for this feature spring is more popular in market
		 - Mainly it based on two concept DI(Dependency Injection) & IOC (Inversion of control)
		 
		- IoC -- Inversion of Control
			 - It is an architectural(design) pattern describing that programmer do not need to create an object, instead just describe how it should be created. No need to directly connect your components & services together in program, instead just describe which services are needed by which components in a configuration file/xml file. The spring IOC container is then responsible.
			- IOC create a singleton object means that object create only ones instance & we can use that object through out the application whenever we need.


IOC Container Has 2 types

 1 BeanFactory (I)
	- It is Interface
	- we can use some implementated classess using this interface

 2 ApplicationContext (I)
	- It is Interface
	- we can use some implementated classess using this interface
	- Application Context is nothing but spring container.In newer version of spring Application Context to developed enterprise application.
	- class is used ClassPathXMLApplicationContext


			
	- DI -- Dependency Injection
	- The object initialization is done by spring -- adding dependencies into the object (i.e. initializing its properties).

			- DI is way to achieving the IOC.i.e to implement IOC we required Dependency Injection
			- Runtime object creation is not allowed
			- It Create Object before runtime & it inject whenever we want it gives object.
